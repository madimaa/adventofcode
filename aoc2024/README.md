This project uses [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), it's a really good library so check it out if you want to create CLI applications in Go.

To run the first day, in your project directory run the following:
```bash
go run main.go day01
```

This project also uses [Cobra Generator](https://github.com/spf13/cobra-cli), whis is also a great tool. ðŸ™‚
To add a new day to the CLI:
```bash
cobra-cli add dayXY
```
